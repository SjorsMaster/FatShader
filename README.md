# FatShader
Today I have written a FatShader for a small game in Unity Engine.

Why Unity Engine? Unity one of the biggest engines that is being used all over the world. 

It's easy to use, [multi-platform](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/multiplatform), [well documented](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) and on top of that [lightweight(high performance)](https://unity3d.com/unity) Meaning it'll run on just about anything without much tweaking!

While Unity is great for these things it doesn't look nice straight out of the box unlike Unreal Engine, these effects are still achievable through the things called *"Shaders"*.

These shaders are usually speaking included in Unreal, leaving all the games looking impressive. However, It makes it usable on very few platforms since it's so intense..

I myself wanted to explore a little bit of this shader world. Why? Well just so that I can [create amazing things with these ofcourse](https://medium.com/@darkdreamday/meet-the-shaders-vertices-polygons-and-meshes-1dde115c4bc6)! I've only endulged myself a little bit in them with the ordering layers. Visual manipulations is something that sets your game apart from the rest, as such that is something I would like to have a grip of. These things also let you do effects which are not CPU intensive but GPU intensive. So instead of doing all the calculations in one place, you spread it out. Leaving a better experience for the player. This is a skill highly demanded by companies.

Why don't a lot of people do shaders if it's demanded so much you might ask, that's because they're highly complex compared to the rest of the programming scene. But it's definitely worth it.

## So what have I created?
- [A shader that manipulates the vertices](https://github.com/SjorsMaster/FatShader/blob/master/Shader/Assets/Shaders/Shaper.shader)
- [A scrolling texture shader](https://github.com/SjorsMaster/FatShader/blob/master/Shader/Assets/Shaders/Scroll.shader)
- Quick code around the shaders for a "Small game"

## Goals
- Expanding my shader skills.
- Getting a better understanding of shaders themselves and how they work.

## Planning 
These we're the plannings I was supposed to follow, I thought this was pretty duable.
